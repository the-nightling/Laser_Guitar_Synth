Laser_Guitar_Synth
==================

The laser guitar synthesizer synthesizes guitar sounds using the Karplus-Strong algorithm.
An STM32F4 microcontroller is used.

The relevant pin connections can be found in the Hardware folder.
Six laser diodes were used to generate six lasers that are being used instead of actual guitar strings. Those are paired with six photodiodes and fed into a multiplexer.
